# ODM Algorithm
We have open-sourced the code for the ODM (Orthogonal Dictionary Matching) algorithm to facilitate research in signal processing and sparse representation. 

Main: a demo that can be used to test the algorithm's runtime under different parameters.
ODM1: ODM algorithm with the stopping criterion based on the number of iterations 
ODM2ï¼šODM algorithm with the stopping criterion based on the target error
